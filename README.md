# Biomedical_DataScience_Lab

This reposetory will be used to store and maintain the different implementations of GraphNeuralNetworks(GNNs) that will be produced by me throughout the Biomedical Datascience Lab in WS22/23

It currently stores:
miniBatchGCN.py -> Nodeprediction GNN for the OGB Proteins dataset, based on Graph Convolutional Networks. I created this script mainly to get a grip of common GNN schemes,
like mini Batching or the optimization of hyperparametrs via Optuna.
