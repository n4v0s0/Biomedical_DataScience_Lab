# Biomedical_DataScience_Lab

This reposetory will be used to store and maintain the different implementations of GraphNeuralNetworks(GNNs) that will be produced by me throughout the Biomedical Datascience Lab in WS22/23

It currently stores: <br>
## SageLinkPrediction.py
-> Linkprediction on the PrimeKG Dataset using SAGE encoder. Dataset split with RandomLinkSplit. <br>
## SageLinkPredictionMetricsInstances.py 
-> Linkprediction on the PrimeKG Dataset using SAGE encoder. Dataset split with SKlearn's train_test_split. Training on fixed set. <br>
## SageLinkPredictionKfold.py 
-> Linkprediction on the PrimeKG Dataset using SAGE encoder. Dataset split with SKlearn's train_test_split. Training on k-Folds using k-Fold Cross Validation.
